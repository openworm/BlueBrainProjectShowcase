Some scripts for converting channel files in Channelpedia's native format to NeuroML2.

To use the Python scripts here you will need to install a number of NeuroML related packages.

See the **install** section of https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/.travis.yml for details.

### [ChannelpediaToNeuroML2.py](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/blob/master/Channelpedia/ChannelpediaToNeuroML2.py)

This can be used to convert XML files for channels in Channelpedia's native format to NeuroML2.

### [test](test)

This folder contains examples of Channelpedia channels converted to NeuroML2. 

**Generated plots of the activation/inactivation variables** of these channels can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/BlueBrainProjectShowcase/tree/master/Channelpedia/test/channel_summary).
